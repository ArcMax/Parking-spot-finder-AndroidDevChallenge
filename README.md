Find parking spot near me!

I'm trying to solve a simple problem of finding a parking spot near me, currently focusing for SFO. There are many studies which show how much time an average person spends trying to find a parking spot. Finding a spot is like hunting for a needle in a haystack. When you do find one, itâ€™s hard not to approach it with trepidation- Why is this spot empty?
