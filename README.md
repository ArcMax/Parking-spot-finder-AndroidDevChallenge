Find parking spot near me!

I'm trying to solve a simple problem to find a parking spot near me, currently focusing for SFO. There are many research which shows, how much time the average person spends finding a street parking space, you also know that street parking can be a downright nightmare. Finding a spot is like hunting for a needle in a haystack, and when you do find one, itâ€™s hard not to approach it with trepidation: Why is this spot empty?.  I'm also one of them spends a lot of time finding parking space & also got citation fee too once.
